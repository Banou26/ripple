/**
 * Everything a share link needs, read out of a `.torrent` or a magnet WITHOUT the engine.
 *
 * The share dialog used to hand whatever it was given to the library's add path and then wait for
 * the torrent to come back. That produced a link, and it also silently added the torrent to
 * somebody's library, which is not what "make me a link" asks for. Nobody wants a download started
 * because they wanted a url.
 *
 * It was never necessary either. A `.torrent` already contains the infohash, the name, the file
 * list and the trackers, which is the whole of what a link is built from. A magnet contains the
 * infohash and usually a name. So both are read here, in the page, and the engine is left alone.
 *
 * The one thing a magnet cannot give is the file list, because that lives in metadata the swarm has
 * to deliver. `files: null` says so, and the dialog offers a whole-torrent link, which is correct
 * and complete on its own.
